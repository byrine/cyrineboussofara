<p align="justify">In this repository, I am giving an overview of the main projects I worked on that are related to the computer vision field.</p>

<p align="justify">In the project PointNet++ which was mainly investigating object detection for 3D point cloud, I made use of the [Tensorflow implementation of PointNet++] ( https://github.com/
charlesq34/pointnet2) and made modifications in order to perform new tests and gather results.</p>

<p align="justify">In the project Visnav, which was performing visual-based navigation, the first step was to do assignments by filling the missing functions and methods in order to reconstruct
the 3D map at the end, these different tasks were including keypoint detection and matching, and the second part of the project was to modify the framework, test different
keypoint detectors and matchers and evaluating among other things their precision, recall and absolute trajectory error.</p>

<p align="justify">In the project occlusion_prob, I implemented a method that aimed to correct the data detected by the object detector YOLOv7 by detecting occlusions and categorizing them,
this included using algorithms like Hungarian algorithm, Intersection over Union and others and the goal was to gather different statistics to help us understand when objects
start to not being detected anymore or wrongly detected and which error is the most occuring one and evaluate the proposed method.</p>
